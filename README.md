# Agent-Aisle-Buddy

Kaggle AI Agent Capstone Group Project

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a multi-agent AI system designed to support complete wedding planning from start to finish. Our primary agent functions as an orchestrator, delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents responsible for individual domains such as logistics, scheduling, food and vendor coordination, photography planning, and vow writing. Each agent focuses on its designated area of expertise, and the orchestrator aggregates their outputs into a unified, comprehensive solution for the user. This project highlights how coordinated AI agents can streamline complex workflows and deliver structured, end-to-end assistance for real-world planning scenarios.

## Problem

Planning a wedding is a complex, multi-layered process that requires coordinating countless details—timelines, budgets, vendors, logistics, aesthetics, photography, vows, and more. Couples often rely on numerous tools and spreadsheets to calculate costs, manage schedules, compare options, and track progress, which can quickly become overwhelming. Professional wedding planners can help, but their services are often expensive and out of reach for many couples. 

## Solution

By leveraging AI to organize information, analyze needs, and automate decision-making, planning becomes more accessible, efficient, and less stressful. This allows couples to focus on the meaningful aspects of their day rather than managing the logistics behind it.
